# Pre-requisites

Before using HyperTest, you have to download Concierge CLI corresponding to the host OS. Along with it, you also need to export the environment variables *LT_USERNAME* and *LT_ACCESS_KEY* that are available in the [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile) page.

## Download Concierge

Concierge is a CLI for interacting and running the tests on the HyperTest Grid. Concierge provides a host of other useful features that accelerate test execution. In order to trigger tests using Concierge, you need to download the Concierge binary corresponding to the platform (or OS) from where the tests are triggered:

Also, it is recommended to download the binary in the project's parent directory. Shown below is the location from where you can download the Concierge binary: 

* Mac: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/concierge/darwin/concierge
* Linux: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/concierge/linux/concierge
* Windows: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/concierge/windows/concierge.exe

## Configure Environment Variables

Before the tests are run, please set the environment variables LT_USERNAME & LT_ACCESS_KEY from the terminal. The account details are available on your [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile) page.

For macOS:

```bash
export LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

For Linux:

```bash
export LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

For Windows:

```bash
set LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
set LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

# Matrix Execution with PyTest

Matrix-based test execution is used for running the same tests across different test (or input) combinations. The Matrix directive in HyperTest YAML file is a *key:value* pair where value is an array of strings.

Also, the *key:value* pairs are opaque strings for HyperTest. For more information about matrix multiplexing, check out the [Matrix Getting Started Guide](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/getting-started-with-hypertest/#matrix-based-build-multiplexing)

### Core

In the current example, matrix YAML file (*yaml/pytest_hypertest_matrix_sample.yaml*) in the repo contains the following configuration:

```yaml
globalTimeout: 90
testSuiteTimeout: 90
testSuiteStep: 90
```

Global timeout, testSuite timeout, and testSuite timeout are set to 90 minutes.
 
The target platform is set to Windows. Please set the *[runson]* key to *[mac]* if the tests have to be executed on the macOS platform. 

```yaml
runson: win
```

WebdriverIO Feature files in the 'Features' folder contain the Feature Scenario run on the HyperTest grid. In the example, the Feature file *Features/ToDo.feature* run in parallel on the basis of scenario by using the specified input combinations.

```yaml
matrix:
   os: [win]
   tags: ["@ToDoThree","@ToDoOne","@ToDoTwo"]

```

The *testSuites* object contains a list of commands (that can be presented in an array). In the current YAML file, commands for executing the tests are put in an array (with a '-' preceding each item). The npx command is used to run tests in *.feature* files. The tags are mentioned as an array to the *tags* key that is a part of the matrix.

```yaml
testSuites:
  - npx wdio wdio.conf.js --cucumberOpts.tagExpression $tags
```

### Pre Steps and Dependency Caching

Dependency caching is enabled in the YAML file to ensure that the package dependencies are not downloaded in subsequent runs. The first step is to set the Key used to cache directories.

```yaml
cacheKey: '{{ checksum "package-lock.json" }}'
```

Set the array of files & directories to be cached. In the example, all the packages will be cached in the *CacheDir* directory.

```yaml
cacheDirectories:
  - node_modules
```

Steps (or commands) that must run before the test execution are listed in the *pre* run step. In the example, the packages listed in *requirements.txt* are installed using the *npm install* command.

```yaml
pre:
  - npm install
```


### Artefacts Management

The *mergeArtifacts* directive (which is by default *false*) is set to *true* for merging the artefacts and combing artefacts generated under each task.

The *uploadArtefacts* directive informs HyperTest to upload artefacts [files, reports, etc.] generated after task completion. In the example, *path* consists of a regex for parsing the directory (i.e. *reports* that contains the test reports).

```yaml
mergeArtifacts: true

uploadArtefacts:
  [{
    "name": "Reports",
    "path": ["Reports\\"]
  }]
```

HyperTest also facilitates the provision to download the artefacts on your local machine. To download the artefacts, click on Artefacts button corresponding to the associated TestID.

## Test Execution

The CLI option *--config* is used for providing the custom HyperTest YAML file (i.e. *HyperExecute-Yaml/.hyperTestMatrix.yaml.yaml*). Run the following command on the terminal to trigger the tests in Feature file Scenario on the HyperTest grid. 

```bash
./concierge --config --verbose HyperExecute-Yaml/.hyperTestMatrix.yaml
```

Visit [HyperTest Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/hypertest) to check the status of execution:


## Auto-Split Execution with Webdriverio

Auto-split execution mechanism lets you run tests at predefined concurrency and distribute the tests over the available infrastructure. Concurrency can be achieved at different levels - file, module, test suite, test, scenario, etc.

For more information about auto-split execution, check out the [Auto-Split Getting Started Guide](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/getting-started-with-hypertest/#smart-auto-test-splitting)

### Core

Auto-split YAML file (*HyperExecute-Yaml\.hypertestStatic.yaml*) in the repo contains the following configuration:

```yaml
globalTimeout: 90
testSuiteTimeout: 90
testSuiteStep: 90
```

Global timeout, testSuite timeout, and testSuite timeout are set to 90 minutes.
 
The *runson* key determines the platform (or operating system) on which the tests are executed. Here we have set the target OS as Windows.

```yaml
runson: win
```

Auto-split is set to true in the YAML file.

```yaml
 autosplit: true
``` 

*retryOnFailure* is set to true, instructing HyperTest to retry failed command(s). The retry operation is carried out till the number of retries mentioned in *maxRetries* are exhausted or the command execution results in a *Pass*. In addition, the concurrency (i.e. number of parallel sessions) is set to 2.

```yaml
retryOnFailure: true
runson: win
maxRetries: 2
```

## Pre Steps and Dependency Caching

To leverage the advantage offered by *Dependency Caching* in HyperTest, the integrity of *package-lock.json* is checked using the checksum functionality.

```yaml
cacheKey: '{{ checksum "package-lock.json" }}'
```

The caching advantage offered by *NPM* can be leveraged in HyperTest, whereby the downloaded packages can be stored (or cached) in a secure server for future executions. The packages available in the cache will only be used if the checksum stage results in a Pass.



```yaml
cacheDirectories:
  - node_modules
```

The *testDiscovery* directive contains the command that gives details of the mode of execution, along with detailing the command that is used for test execution. Here, we are fetching the list of Feature file scenario that would be further executed using the *value* passed in the *testRunnerCommand*

```yaml
testDiscovery:
  mode: static
  args:
    featureFilePaths: Features/
    frameWork: java
    specificTags: ["@ToDoOne"]
    range:
     limit: 1
     offset: 0
  type: automatic
  
  testRunnerCommand: npx wdio wdio.conf.js --spec=$test
```

Running the above command on the terminal will give a list of Feature Scenario lines that are located in the Project folder:

Test Discovery Output:
Features/ToDo.feature:7
Features/ToDo.feature:22
Features/ToDo.feature:37

The *testRunnerCommand* contains the command that is used for triggering the test. The output fetched from the *testDiscoverer* command acts as an input to the *testRunner* command.

```yaml
testRunnerCommand: npx wdio wdio.conf.js --spec=$test
```

### Artefacts Management

The *mergeArtifacts* directive (which is by default *false*) is set to *true* for merging the artefacts and combing artefacts generated under each task.

The *uploadArtefacts* directive informs HyperTest to upload artefacts [files, reports, etc.] generated after task completion.  In the example, *path* consists of a regex for parsing the directory (i.e. *reports* that contains the test reports).

```yaml
mergeArtifacts: true

uploadArtefacts:
  [{
    "name": "Reports",
    "path": ["Reports\\"]
  }]
  
```
HyperTest also facilitates the provision to download the artefacts on your local machine. To download the artefacts, click on *Artefacts* button corresponding to the associated TestID.

### Test Execution

The CLI option *--config* is used for providing the custom HyperTest YAML file (i.e. *HyperExecute-Yaml/.hypertestStatic.yaml*). Run the following command on the terminal to trigger the tests in Python files on the HyperTest grid. The *--download-artifacts* option is used to inform HyperTest to download the artefacts for the job.

```bash
./concierge --config --verbose HyperExecute-Yaml/.hypertestStatic.yaml
```

Visit [HyperTest Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/hypertest) to check the status of execution



## Secrets Management

In case you want to use any secret keys in the YAML file, the same can be set by clicking on the *Secrets* button the dashboard.


All you need to do is create an environment variable that uses the secret key:

```yaml
env:
  AccessKey: ${{.secrets.AccessKey}}
```

## Navigation in Automation Dashboard

HyperTest lets you navigate from/to *Test Logs* in Automation Dashboard from/to *HyperTest Logs*. You also get relevant get relevant Selenium test details like video, network log, commands, Exceptions & more in the Dashboard. Effortlessly navigate from the automation dashboard to HyperTest logs (and vice-versa) to get more details of the test execution.
